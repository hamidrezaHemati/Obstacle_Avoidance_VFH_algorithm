# Obstacle_Avoidance_VFH_algorithm
This project focuses on implementing obstacle avoidance using the Vector Field Histogram (VFH) algorithm. We aim to develop a robust system that allows a mobile robot to navigate through complex environments, avoiding obstacles effectively by utilizing VFH-based decision-making.
